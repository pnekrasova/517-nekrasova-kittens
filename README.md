 ## About this Repository
 
 Welcome to my repository! In this README, I will share information about all Eastern European food that I miss in the U.S. 
 
 ### Syrniki
 Syrniki are a type of traditional Eastern European cheese pancake made from fresh cottage cheese. They are slightly sweet, fluffy, and usually served with sour cream, jam, or honey.

#### Ingredients:
- 2 cups of flour

- 1/2 cup of water

- **Filling options:**
  - Mashed potatoes with onions
  - Sweet cherries
  - Cottage cheese with sugar
  
  #### Instructions:
1. **Make the dough**: In a large bowl, mix the flour, egg, water, and salt until a smooth dough forms. Let it rest for 30 minutes.
2. **Prepare the filling**: Choose your filling (e.g., mashed potatoes, cherries, or sweetened cottage cheese) and set it aside.
3. **Shape the Vareniki**: Roll out the dough and cut it into circles. Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each circle, fold, and pinch the edges to seal.
4. **Cook the Vareniki**: Boil water in a pot, add the Vareniki, and cook until they float to the top. Drain and serve with sour cream.
