#### Ingredients:
- 2 cups of flour

- 1/2 cup of water

- **Filling options:**
  - Mashed potatoes with onions
  - Sweet cherries
  - Cottage cheese with sugar

  #### Instructions:
1. **Make the dough**: In a large bowl, mix the flour, egg, water, and salt until a smooth dough forms. Let it rest for 30 minutes.
2. **Prepare the filling**: Choose your filling (e.g., mashed potatoes, cherries, or sweetened cottage cheese) and set it aside.
3. **Shape the Vareniki**: Roll out the dough and cut it into circles. Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each circle, fold, and pinch the edges to seal.
4. **Cook the Vareniki**: Boil water in a pot, add the Vareniki, and cook until they float to the top. Drain and serve with sour cream.


### Borsch
Borsch is more than just a soup; it's a cultural experience. Known for its vibrant red color and complex flavor profile, this dish combines beets with a variety of vegetables and meats. It's often served with a dollop of sour cream and garnished with fresh dill.

#### Is it similar to kombucha?
Kvas is a mildly sweet, fermented drink made from rye bread, while kombucha is a tangy, fizzy drink made from sweet tea fermented with a special culture.
